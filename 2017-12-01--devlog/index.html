  <span class="post-date">2017-12-01</span>
  
  <p>Hi, comrades! Welcome to the second issue of Zemeroth's devlog.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth">Zemeroth</a> is a turn-based hexagonal tactical game written in Rust.</p>
<p>It slowly grows into a middle-sized project:
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth">Zemeroth</a> has <a href="https://github.com/Aaronepower/tokei">4.3k LoCs</a> and 82üåü now.
Though I still can't find enough free time to work on it on daily basis
and I have to take weeks-long breaks sometimes.</p>
<p>So, the progress is quite slow üêå but still,
I've managed to do some amount of useful stuff during last three months.
Here's a short video of how the game looks right now:</p>
<div class="youtube"><iframe frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrC4eCqspUo?rel=0&showinfo=0"></iframe></div>
<p>Ok, let's talk about what exactly have I done for the project during this autumn.</p>
<h2 id="pre-built-binaries"><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/56">Pre-built binaries</a></h2>
<p>The most important change for anyone who wants to try out Zemeroth
and don't want to compile it from the source
is auto-deployed pre-built binaries.</p>
<p><strong>You can download them here:</strong>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/releases">zemeroth/releases</a></strong></p>
<p>They are compiled and deployed to Github's releases
by CI servers (Travis, Appveyor and CircleCI) on every tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/releases/tag/v0.0.3">The latest release at the time of writing is <code>v0.0.3</code></a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/releases/tag/v0.0.3"><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/v-0-0-3-release-page.png" alt="v.0.0.3 release page" /></a></p>
<p>Linux/Windows and OSX versions are not that interesting - they are
built exactly like <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc/issues/242">it was done for ZoC</a>.</p>
<p>Deploying Android <code>apk</code>s is a more interesting story.</p>
<p>I've stolen basic apk-building script for CircleCI from <a href="https://github.com/tomaka">@tomaka</a>
(thanks again!) - <a href="https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/pull/919">https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/pull/919</a> -
and it worked straight out of the box.</p>
<p>Deploying <code>apk</code>s is harder:
circle-ci doesn't provide a built-in convenient way of deploying to Github,
so you have to wield some curl/github_api magic.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/blob/efc36eb08/.circleci/upload_apk_to_github_releases.sh">All the magic is packed in .circleci/upload_apk_to_github_releases.sh script</a>
(which is based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/stefanbuck/ce788fee19ab6eb0b4447a85fc99f447">this gist</a>).</p>
<p>Also, some <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/blob/efc36eb08/.circleci/config.yml#L20-L33">strange branch magic is required</a>
if you don't want to run both <code>build</code> and <code>deploy</code> targets
on <em>every</em> commit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Btw, old badges were not that clear of what do they mean:</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/old-badges.png" alt="build: passing, build: passing, passed - wtf?" /></p>
<p>Most programmers know that travis's badge usually means
Linux/OSX builds and appveyor is for Windows builds.
But what does the third one?</p>
<p>To fix this
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/pull/158/commits/1f0fc2b75">I've added custom labels to the badges through shields.io</a>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<span style="color:#c0c5ce;">https://img.shields.io/travis/ozkriff/zemeroth/master.svg?label=Linux|OSX
https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ozkriff/zemeroth.svg?label=Windows
https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/ozkriff/zemeroth/master.svg?label=Android
</span></pre>
<p>Looks a little bit better now:</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/new-badges.png" alt="uniform new badges" /></p>
<hr />
<p><em>And there're two yet-to-be-solved issues:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/136"><code>apk</code>s are built in the debug mode</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/161">Deploy precompiled versions of the latest commit to a special release</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decorations-grass-and-blood-pools">Decorations: Grass and Blood Pools</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/73"><strong>Grass</strong></a> is just a randomly-placed decoration,
but <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/42"><strong>Blood Pools</strong></a> are also an additional indicator
of a successful attack:</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/grass.png" alt="two tiles of grass" />
<img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/bool-of-blood.png" alt="pool of blood" /></p>
<h2 id="jokers-and-strength">Jokers and Strength</h2>
<p>Now, some actual gameplay changes!</p>
<p>To make Zemeroth a little bit more tactical
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/59"><strong>Jokers were added</strong></a>. They can be used either as Attacks or Moves.</p>
<p>In the previous version, units were dying from a single hit.
That doesn't work well with reaction attacks as they were dying too quickly:
fighters should have some kind of basic hit points.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/63">So <strong>Strength</strong> was added.</a></p>
<p>This name is stolen from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/The_Banner_Saga">Banner Saga</a>:
as I'm going to use this property also as a basic attack modifier.
Right now every successful attack deals a damage of one strength
but later a much more fine-grained battle math will be implemented.</p>
<h2 id="dots">Dots</h2>
<p>To show the most important dynamic information about units on the map
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/95"><strong>&quot;Dots&quot;</strong> were added</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/info-dots.png" alt="thee agents with different stats showed by color dots" /></p>
<p>The current legend is:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Strength&quot; - green;</li>
<li>&quot;Attacks&quot; - red;</li>
<li>&quot;Moves&quot; - blue;</li>
<li>&quot;Jokers&quot; - purple.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://github.com/LPGhatguy">@LPGhatguy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LPGhatguy/status/902800456082001920">pointed me out on twitter</a> to a problem with colors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the amount of red/green in the game so far,
you should try it with a Deuteranopia filter!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've googled a simulator:
<a href="https://www.etre.com/tools/colourblindsimulator">etre.com/tools/colourblindsimulator</a>.
Here's an example of its output:</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/color-issue.png" alt="Example of output. Dots are hard to read now" /></p>
<p>And, yeah, that doesn't look readable at all.
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/98">It's clear that I should change the colors and shapes</a>
in the near future.</p>
<p><em>Btw, <a href="http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com">http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com</a> is a very interesting resource.
I've never thought about a lot of issues raised and explained there.</em></p>
<h2 id="info-panel-with-selected-unit-s-stats"><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/pull/92">Info panel with selected unit's stats</a></h2>
<p>Dots can show only a small portion of the dynamic information about units.
Other less important dynamic or static information goes into the side panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/info-panel.png" alt="info panel showing imp's stats using text" /></p>
<p>Btw, <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/pull/100">now you can select enemy units</a> to see their move range and stats
in the info panel.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: additionally, a deselection of any unit on the second click was added.</em></p>
<h2 id="spearman"><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/65">Spearman</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/spearman.png" alt="closeup of a spearman" /></p>
<p>Another important gameplay change is
an addition of third fighter type: &quot;Spearman&quot;.</p>
<p>He has an attack radius of two tiles and
can control with reaction attacks a big area of 18 tiles around him.</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/spearman-controls-territory.png" alt="spearman can attack distant enemies" /></p>
<p>On the picture above the spearman has only one Joker point:
this is not an attack unit, he's almost useless during his own turn.</p>
<p>But if spearman hasn't used its Joker during his own turn,
he has <em>four</em> reaction attacks during enemy's turn:</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/spearman-many-reaction-attacks.png" alt="example of a spearman with 4 reactive attacks" /></p>
<p>And that's a lot considering that reaction attacks can interrupt enemy's movement.</p>
<p>Also, this unit has only three Strength points to accent his defence role.</p>
<h2 id="rancor-a-stupid-component-system"><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/141">Ranc√∂r</a> - a Stupid Component System</h2>
<p>Previously, Zemeroth's units were represented by a single struct
holding all the stuff as its fields.
Not a very adaptable solutions and it was impossible
to create a non-unit type of objects.</p>
<p>It's the end of 2017 so the solution to this problem is obviously <em>components</em>.</p>
<p>With a component system, I should be able to implement:
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/142">Boulders</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/69">Bombs</a>,
Fire,
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/154">Poison stuff</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/108">Corpses</a>,
etc.</p>
<p>I don't think Zemeroth needs a full-featured ECS solution
(like <a href="https://github.com/slide-rs/specs">specs</a>) as the game is turn-based.
A bunch of <code>HashMap&lt;ObjId, ComponentType&gt;</code> will do the work fine.</p>
<p>So.. I've reinvented another ~~<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6zdvza/my_experience_participating_in_highload_cup_re/dmulhzj">bicycle üö≤</a>~~ square wheel! \o/</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/141">Meet <strong>Ranc√∂r</strong> - a simple macro-based component system</a>.
I'm not calling this an ECS because it has no systems, it's just a storage.</p>
<p>Nothing fancy, you just declare some usual structs for components
and create a hidden <code>HashMap</code>-based monster-struct using a friendly macro:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<span style="color:#c0c5ce;">rancor_storage!(Parts&lt;ObjId&gt;: {
    strength: component::Strength,
    pos: component::Pos,
    meta: component::Meta,
    belongs_to: component::BelongsTo,
    agent: component::Agent,
});
</span></pre>
<p>And then use individual fields:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<span style="color:#c0c5ce;">parts.agent.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">insert</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">(id, agent);
...
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> agent = </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">self</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">.state.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">parts</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">().agent.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">get</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">(id);
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">if</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> agent.moves == Moves(</span><span style="color:#d08770;">0</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">) &amp;&amp; agent.jokers == Jokers(</span><span style="color:#d08770;">0</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">) { ... }
...
parts.agent.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">remove</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">(id);
</span></pre>
<p>Or call <code>parts.remove(id);</code> to completely wipe-out the entity.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rancor seems to work fine, but I see two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many braces in RON file with prototypes</li>
<li><a href="(https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/105#issuecomment-335439037)">Duplication of data between initial values and their base values</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As I do not expect anyone to use it, this carte lives in the Zemeroth's repo.</p>

<h2 id="toml-ron"><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/pull/67">TOML -&gt; RON</a></h2>
<p>Rust community kinda loves TOML, but I'm not a fan of this format.
TOML is not <em>that</em> bad, but I find its tables too strange for anything
but simple configs.</p>
<p>And I've decided to try to use <strong><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">RON</a></strong> format for Zemeroth.</p>
<p><em>(<a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">RON's readme</a> has a pretty good list of reasons
of why you may not want to use other formats)</em></p>

<h2 id="boulders-and-rocks">Boulders and Rocks</h2>
<p>To make tactics a little bit more interesting
and to prototype non-agent objects using Ranc√∂r
I've <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/142">added some tile-blocking <strong>Boulders</strong></a>.
This is a first non-agent object type in the game.</p>
<p>It's a little bit strange that I have different terrain types
support for a long time, but not actually using them in the game at all.
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/pull/164">Meet randomly-placed tiles of <strong>TileType::Rocks</strong> type</a>.
You can move through these tiles, but it requires 3 move points and not 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://ozkriff.games/2017-12-01--devlog/rocks.png" alt="a map with some boulders and rock tiles" /></p>
<p>Rock tiles and boulders work together with blood and grass to make
the battlefield look a little bit less boring.</p>
<p><em>(Yes, I know that it'll be better to use a different texture for Rocks tiles,
not just a darker color)</em></p>
<h2 id="logging-log-env-logger"><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/83">Logging: <code>log</code> &amp; <code>env_logger</code></a></h2>
<p>I'm tired of adding a special-cased <code>println</code>s to debug
something small and removing them before the commit.</p>
<p>As I don't have much experience with slog, I decided
to replace <code>println</code>s with a classic <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger">env_logger</a>.
It seems to work, for now,
the source code is filled with all kinds of <code>info!</code> and <code>debug!</code> calls. :)</p>
<h2 id="hate-examples">H√§te: <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/pull/131">Examples</a></h2>
<p>Some news about <a href="https://ozkriff.github.io/2017-08-17--devlog.html#hate2d">my silly game engine</a>.</p>
<p>It's important to decouple H√§te from Zemeroth.
First, H√§te was extracted to a separate crate inside the repo.
The next step is to separate example/test screens.</p>
<p>These screens do nothing game-specific so they belong to the engine.</p>
<p>There was a bunch of tasks needed to be solved before extracting the examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/129">Baked GLSL shaders into H√§te's source</a>.
They are supposed to be dead-simple &amp; tightly coupled with
the engine - what's the point of having them in user's assets dir?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/130">Baked a default font into H√§te's source</a>.
I've used the smallest font from this article:
<a href="http://oxfordshireweb.com/smallest-file-size-google-web-fonts">http://oxfordshireweb.com/smallest-file-size-google-web-fonts</a>.
<code>Karla-Regular.ttf</code> is 17kib only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/138"><code>Settings::default</code></a>. Simplified the examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/32">Check assets dir from every <code>fs::load</code> call</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hate-cache-text-textures">H√§te: <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/96">Cache Text Textures</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc">ZoC</a> was almost unusable in debug builds:
<a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc/issues/264">it may take more than 10 seconds to start a game on some machines</a>
and now I'm trying to keep Zemeroth's debug builds fast enough.</p>
<p>One of the common problems is that <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/rusttype">Rusttype</a> is very slow in debug builds,
especially on Android.
As a text in H√§te is rendered by creating a separate texture for
every string the simplest solution was to cache these textures.</p>
<p>Caching is a little bit sloppy solution, but we have no other choice
until <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1359">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1359</a> is implemented.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Btw, there's a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1359#issuecomment-329653216">cool hack</a> from <a href="https://github.com/matklad">@matklad</a>,
but you have to compile an outdated cargo from his dev-branch.</em></p>

<h3 id="restructuredtext-markdown">RestructuredText -&gt; Markdown</h3>
<p>For a long time, I was trying to avoid the use of MD.</p>
<p>Mostly <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/restructuredtext-vs-markdown-for-technical-documentation">because MD has no built-in support for extensions and
is MD is forever tied to HTML</a>.</p>
<p>I was mostly hoping for RST to become popular enough.
There was a chance, <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rustdoc-restructuredtext-vs-markdown/356">but doc team decided to stay with MD</a>
and now Rust community doesn't care about RST at all. :(</p>
<p><a href="http://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a> solves the standardization problem to some degree.
Though, it's still glued to HTML and is not easily extensible.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not going to use these documents anywhere except in the web browser,
so... <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/157">I'm going to migrate this blog to some rust blog generator</a>
from Pelican. This post is written in MD already.</p>
<h3 id="abilities-and-lasting-effects">Abilities and Lasting Effects</h3>
<p>A skirmish game is unimaginable without <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/110">special abilities</a>
and some interesting <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/102">instant</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth/issues/154">lasting effects</a> of the actions.</p>
<p>So, here are some previews of what I'm working right now:</p>
